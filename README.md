Iâ€™m Manoj Nawale â€” a curious builder who believes technology should make life simpler, smarter, and more meaningful.

I enjoy turning questions into systems â€” building data pipelines, structuring information, and designing tools that support better decisions.

Iâ€™m driven by the why behind problems, not just the how. I learn by doing, explore with intent, and build with care.

Always learning. Always improving. Always building with the next question in mind.
