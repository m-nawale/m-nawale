Hi, I'm Manoj 👋

I'm an engineer and systems thinker based in Karlsruhe, Germany, with a Master's in Production & Operations Management from KIT. By day, I build decision support systems for production planning—architecting MILP optimization workflows (Gurobi), designing ETL pipelines (SQLAlchemy, Airflow), and creating dashboards (Power BI) that help planners make better decisions.

By night (and weekends), I tinker here.

🔍 What you'll find in my repos:
- Experiments with optimization models and scenario analysis
- Data pipelines and ETL patterns I find interesting
- Simulation projects (SimPy) exploring production and logistics problems
- The occasional deep dive into Python tooling (Pydantic, Alembic, FastAPI)
- Messy but honest explorations of things I'm learning

🎯 Current fixations:
- Explainability in optimization (what happens after solve()?)
- Reproducible data workflows
- Building things that work in the real world, not just in notebooks

🌱 Always learning: German (B1 in progress), cloud tools, and whatever problem crosses my desk next.
